This is a project for the freeCodeCamp course "Relational Databases", more information [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/build-a-world-cup-database-project/build-a-world-cup-database)

From the initial 'games.csv', which provided statistics to some games from the knockout stages of a couple of world cups, I built a SQL database with PostgreSQL.

While upholding some conditions and restrictions from freeCodeCamp, I built the 'teams' and 'games' databases and populated them with a Bash Script I wrote: [insert_data.sh](https://github.com/Ulukai85/world-cup-database/blob/main/insert_data.sh).

Then, as a last step wrote [queries.sh](https://github.com/Ulukai85/world-cup-database/blob/main/queries.sh) to answer some SQL queries.
